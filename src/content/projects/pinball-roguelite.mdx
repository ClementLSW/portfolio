## The Pitch

**Pinball meets boss rush meets roguelike.**

Each boss is a pinball table. Defeat them by hitting weak points, collecting power-ups, and managing your limited balls. Between bosses, choose upgrades that modify your playstyle.

## Current Status

🚧 **In Development** — Building for Global Game Jam Singapore 2026

### What's Working
- Core pinball physics (finally!)
- Basic boss damage system
- Flipper controls that feel responsive

### What's Next
- Boss attack patterns
- Roguelike upgrade system
- Visual polish and juice

## Design Goals

1. **Make pinball feel like combat** — Each hit should feel impactful
2. **Strategic ball management** — Limited balls = meaningful decisions
3. **Roguelike variety** — Runs should feel different each time
