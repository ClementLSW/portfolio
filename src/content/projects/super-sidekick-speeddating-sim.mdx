## The Pitch

**Learn about your Sidekicks and win their favor.**

Being a sidekick is tough work and unsurprisingly dangerous. It's no wonder why it's so tough to find good help. Take a helm as one of two Superheroes competing for sidekicks.

How? Show them you care!

## Current Status

🚧 **Released** — Developed for Garena Game Jam 2025

### Controls
- Movement (Resume Viewing) - **WASD** (Player 1) / **Arrow Keys** (Player 2)

- Interact - **Space** (Player 1) / **Return** (Player 2)

- Movement (Answer Selection) - **WS** (Player 1) / **UpDown** (Player 2)

### What's Working
- Fighting over control of the resume
- Answering of Questions

## Design Goals

1. **Fun Party Game vibes** — There must be an element of hilarious competition between the players
2. **High Cognitive load** — It should feel challenging to remember so many things
