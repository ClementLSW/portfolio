## The Pitch

**Express your inner thoughts without losing track of it.**

Type out your inner thoughts while trying to stay focused. 
Sounds simple, doesn't it? What if you were really hungry? could you really stop those thoughts 
from drowning your other thoughts out? What about the stupid uwu birds or your neighbour scolding her kids?

## Devlog

This was an interesting project as we set out to challenge ourselves to create a game in an engine we have never used before, Godot.

It was surprisingly not as difficult as we feared. I think what contributed to it was a clear scope and design choices that were made really early in the Jam.

For this Jam, the team worked like a well oiled machine, creating one of my proudest games in my entire career thus far.
