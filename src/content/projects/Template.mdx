## The Pitch

**Pinball meets boss rush.**

Elevator Pitch of the Game Concept

## Current Status

🚧 **STAUS** — [Additional Info]

### Controls
- **Left/Right Shift** for Left/Right Flippers
- Hold **Space** to pull back plunger

### What's Working
- Core pinball physics (finally!)
- Basic boss damage system
- Flipper controls that feel responsive

### What's Next
- Variations in table layouts depending on boss.
- Roguelike upgrade system
- Visual polish and juice

## Design Goals

1. **Make pinball feel like combat** — Each hit should feel impactful
2. **Strategic ball management** — Limited balls = meaningful decisions
