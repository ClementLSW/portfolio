This was a school project created for a Game Design Project. The premise was simple, create a game that conveyed a narrative without dialogue. We wanted to capture the feeling of two friends playing a lighthearted game until they are hit with a twist.

## Design Choices

### Local Multiplayer

We decided early on that we wanted to have the game be built around a two player local multiplayer experience. This meant that we needed to make sure the playing field was limited to ensure the players could focus on what they were doing rather than trying to locate their characters all the time

## Cooking Chaos

We were heavily inspired by the unique combination of collaboration and competition as seen in the Overcooked! series. we intentionally made the movement lanes sightly cramped to make it challenging for the players to navigate the level.

Additionally, we made a conscious effort to space out the interaction elements to force players to actually move around rather than just stay in one spot.

## The twist

Eventually the players will come to a realization. "We are Chickens, Serving Chickens, To Chickens"

And we just ran out of chickens to make nuggets with.

The natural solution is of course to make the players duel it out with shotguns while the customers looked on. Just to add insult to injury, we make the surviving player finish processing their friend, fry them up and serve them up to the customers before the game ends.

## Learning points

* **Simplicity** – A simple game loop executed well can drive the same emotional impact as elaborate multi-system games
* **Prototype Early**
