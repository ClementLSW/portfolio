## The Pitch

**Pinball meets boss rush.**

The player is trapped in a opera house, represented by a pinball table. Defeat the Masked Performers by hitting them with the pinballs and manage your limited balls..

## Current Status

🚧 **Prototype** — Built for Global Game Jam Singapore 2026

### My Role
I came up with the basis of the game and worked with the other designers to make it fun.
I was also the main Systems Designer and Programmer, implementing base pinball mechanics and obstacle behavior.

### Controls
- **Left/Right Shift** for Left/Right Flippers
- Hold **Space** to pull back plunger

### What's Working
- Core pinball physics
- Basic boss damage system
- Transition between masks on direct damage combo
- Flipper controls that feel responsive
- Audio and VFX

### What's Next
- Variations in table layouts depending on boss.
- Roguelike upgrade system
- Visual polish and juice

## Design Goals

1. **Make pinball feel like combat** — Each hit should feel impactful
2. **Strategic ball management** — Limited balls = meaningful decisions
