## The Concept

The theme was **"Make Me Laugh"** — so naturally, we made a game about launching potatoes into the stratosphere.

**Divine Starchy Root Vegetables! We are attempting to leave the stratosphere!** is a collection of absurdist minigames, each contributing to the noble goal of yeeting a potato as far away from Earth as possible.

## My Role

- Core gameplay loop design
- Core gameplay programming
- Integration of minigame scores into launch distance

## The Humor

Comedy in games is hard. We leaned into:

- **Absurdist premise** — The title alone sets expectations
- **Escalating ridiculousness** — Each minigame gets weirder
- **JaaS** — Jank as a Service - Bugs in the minigame made it funnier
- **Physical comedy** — Ragdoll physics do half the work

## What I Learned

- **Commit to the bit** — Half-measures aren't funny
- **Sound design sells comedy** — Our potato "whoosh" sound was crucial
- **Scope for fun, not features** — We really did not care what made our project impressive, only what made it funny.
