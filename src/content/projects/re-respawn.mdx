## The Concept

**Re-Respawn** is a puzzle-platformer where death isn't the end—it's a mechanic. Your previous "deaths" leaves behind a tombstone that conveniently serves as a platform (and more).

Created in 48 hours for Gamecraft 2023, hosted by NUS Game Development Group.

## My Role

As the primary designer and programmer, I was responsible for:

- Core gameplay loop ideation
- Player controller and physics

## The Challenge

The main design challenge was making death feel **useful** rather than punishing. We wanted players to intentionally die in strategic locations to alter the level.

## What I Learned

- **One Mechanic to Rule Them All** — KISS
- **Own your wins** — I was hesitant to take credit for the game because imposter syndrome
- **Death can be fun** — With the right framing, failure becomes experimentation

## Play It

You can play Re-Respawn on [itch.io](https://buburito.itch.io/re-respawn) and view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClementLSW/Gamecraft-2023).
