title: About Me
---

Game designer and aspiring studio founder based in Singapore.

I believe games have unique power to create empathy, teach systems thinking, and bring people together. I'm working toward starting my own studio focused on narrative-driven interactive experiences.

Currently building my portfolio through game jams and personal projects while working as a Product Manager at [Workato](https://workato.com)—where I've learned how to ship products, coordinate cross-functional teams, and make hard trade-offs under pressure.

## Background

I graduated from **DigiPen Singapore** with a Bachelor's in User Experience and Game Design. Before that, I served as a Cyber Security Specialist with the Singapore Armed Forces, and interned at **Ubisoft Singapore** working on Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

Yes, that means I've shipped a AAA game (as a QA intern, but still counts 😄).

## What I'm Looking For

- **Collaborators** — Always looking for people to jam with
- **Producer/Designer roles** — At studios working on interesting projects
- **Conversations** — About games, design, and the industry
