        Game designer and aspiring studio founder based in Singapore.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe games have unique power to create empathy, teach systems thinking, 
        and bring people together. I'm working toward starting my own studio focused 
        on narrative-driven interactive experiences.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently building my portfolio through game jams and personal projects while 
        working as a Product Manager at <span class="text-accent">Workato</span>—where 
        I've learned how to ship products, coordinate cross-functional teams, and make 
        hard trade-offs under pressure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-display text-primary mt-8 sm:mt-12 mb-4 sm:mb-6">BACKGROUND</h2>
      
      <p>
        I graduated from <strong class="text-primary">DigiPen Singapore</strong> with 
        a Bachelor's in User Experience and Game Design. Before that, I served as a 
        Cyber Security Specialist with the Singapore Armed Forces, and interned at 
        <strong class="text-primary">Ubisoft Singapore</strong> working on Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
      </p>
      
      <p>Yes, that means I've shipped a AAA game (as a QA intern, but still counts 😄).</p>
